# Wealthy_Nations-Excel-Tableau

Top 20 ranked countries by GDP, sum of smartphone users and life expectancy

Data visualisation has become an essential business capability to help transform information into insights that can drive meaningful business outcomes and improved experiences. 
Today, most organizations have accumulated a wealth of data from the different corners of their businesses they are then unable to see how this data can help them make better decisions, making actions, and results.
I had been asked to Look at the data workbook and familiarise myself with this data. I had also been asked to create a visual report that will show the data in the form of charts and maps using Excel and Tableau to the clientâ€™s requirements. 

This assignment was very beneficial as I got to show off some of the new technical skills learned on the bootcamp with @JustIt. I was able to extract and upload data from Microsoft Excel to Tableau for data visualisation reports for a specific client. Once the data has been extracted and data manipulation begins to help pull out the top 20 ranked in various tables/charts. Using the design tools across the pane in Tableau allowed me to display my data in various ways with different graphs and charts to display my findings. 

Due to my client being colour blind, keeping his/her needs in mind when presenting my report was a little challenging. This was due to finding the appropriate colours to display in my graphs/charts to meet the clients needs. Luckily, Tableau has built in colour schemes that are colour-blind-friendly. Overall, the assignment was engaging and intuitive.
